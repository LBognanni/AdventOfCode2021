# Advent of code Typescript Starter

A simple [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) starter project with Typescript and jest for testing.

## How to use

Initial setup

 - `npm install`

For each day, where `X` is the day number (1-25):

 - ▶ run `npm run setup X` from your terminal
 - 🌐 Visit [https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/X/input](#fill_in_your_day) and copy the contents in your `inputs/dayX/input.txt` file
 - 🔴 Update the example input and result in the test case in your `.spec.ts` file
 - 🟢 Implement the necessary logic in `solveForPart1` 
 - 💪 TDD all the things!
 - 🔁 Do the same for part 2
 - ⌨ `npm test` to run your tests
 - ⭐ `npm run start X` to run the day's test
 - Profit! 🎉
